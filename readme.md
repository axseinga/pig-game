1. Simple game created with plain Javascript. <br>
2. How to play: Game is created for two players. Player roll the dice. The points accumulate on the current score until the Player roll 1 (then he loses all points and finish the move) or Player can hold the points and add them to the score then finish the move. The Player who get 100 points first wins. <br>
3. <b> I created this game by code along from Jonas Schmedtmann 'The Complete Javascript Course 2021' to understand Javascript logic. </b> In most part I tried to code all by myself before the solution was showed.
